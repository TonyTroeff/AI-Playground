# AI Playground — experiments with small AI tasks 🚀

A lightweight repository for experimenting with AI workflows. Comes with example notebooks, a local Hugging Face model cache, and simple utilities so you can iterate fast.

---

## Quick start (minutes) ✅

1. Install dependencies:

   - CPU:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements_base.txt
     pip install -r requirements_torch.txt
     ```
   - GPU (CUDA-matched):
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements_base.txt
     pip install -r requirements_torch_cuda130.txt
     ```

2. Run the notebooks you are interested in.

## Notes & troubleshooting ⚠️

- Models in `models/huggingface/` are large — remove or re-download as needed.
- For GPU use, ensure your installed `torch` matches your CUDA version (see `requirements_torch_cuda130.txt`).

Happy experimenting! 💡
